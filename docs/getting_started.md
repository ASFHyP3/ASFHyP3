# Getting started

## Using Vertex
[Vertex](https://search.asf.alaska.edu/#/), ASF's data search portal, is the primary method for using HyP3,
It allows you to request jobs and view previous jobs with a friendly interface. For more information
check out [HyP3 in Vertex](using/vertex.md).

## Using the Python SDK
The HyP3 SDK is a Python library intended for people who want to use HyP3 programmatically.
It is available in [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/hyp3-sdk/) and can be installed with `pip install hyp3-sdk`.
Check out [Using the HyP3 SDK](using/sdk.md) for more information.

!!! Warning

    The HyP3 SDK is experimental and still being developed, it should not yet be used in production systems

## Using the API
Both Vertex and the SDK use the API on the back end, but if they don't fit your needs you may call it directly.
Check out the [API docs](using/api.md) for more information.
