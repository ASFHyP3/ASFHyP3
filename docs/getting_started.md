# Getting started

## Using Vertex
Vertex is the primary method for using HyP3, It allows you to request jobs and view
previous jobs with a friendly interface. For more information checkout [HyP3 in Vertex](vertex.md)

## Using the Python SDK
The HyP3 SDK is a Python library intended for people who want to use HyP3 programmatically.
It is available in [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/hyp3-sdk/) and can be installed with `pip install hyp3-sdk`

**The HyP3 SDK is experimental and still being developed, it should not yet be used in production systems**

## Using the API
Both Vertex and the SDK use the API on the back end, but if they don't fit your needs you may call it directly.
Checkout the [API docs](api.md) for more information
