# Getting started

## Using Vertex

[Vertex](https://search.asf.alaska.edu/), ASF's data search portal, is the easiest way to use HyP3.
Vertex provides a friendly interface to request jobs and review previous jobs. Visit
[On Demand Processing in Vertex](https://search.asf.alaska.edu/#/?topic=onDemand) to learn more.

## Using the Python SDK

The HyP3 SDK is a Python library for using HyP3 programmatically. It is available on
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/hyp3-sdk/) and can be installed with `pip install hyp3-sdk`.
Visit [Using HyP3: SDK](using/sdk.md) to learn more.

!!! Warning

    The HyP3 SDK is experimental and still being developed. It should not yet be used in production systems.

## Using the API

The HyP3 web API is the backbone behind Vertex and the SDK. You may also use the API directly. Visit
[Using HyP3: API](using/api.md) to learn more.
