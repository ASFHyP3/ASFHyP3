# Digital Elevation Models (DEMs)

ASF uses publicly-available Digital Elevation Models for processing SAR data.
The DEM used will vary by scene location; the best available DEM with full
coverage of the granule extent will be used for processing any given granule. The
source DEMs include:

- the National Elevation Dataset (NED)
- the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM)

## DEMs Under Evaluation

ASF is currently working to make these DEMs available:

- the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service EU-DEM (EUDEM)
- the Greenland Ice sheet Mapping Project DEM (GIMP)
- and the Reference Elevation Model of Antarctica DSM (REMA)
- IFSAR

## Special Use DEMs

AutoRIFT processes use a custom Greenland and Antarctica DEM for...
